# Simple Message Board

*by Nicholas Neumann-Chun*

A simple message board that uses Node.js, Express.js, and Mongoose.js, with a little bit of Moment.js to format dates nicely. Users can post, edit, and delete messages, and there is a Christmas theme for some reason. To run it, start your local mongodb, then visit http://localhost:3000/messages
